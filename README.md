# Project: Analyzing-Customer-Behavior-in-an-E-commerce-Dataset

Objective: To analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns in an e-commerce dataset and provide actionable insights to improve business performance.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset has been cleaned and transformed for further analysis. Any missing data has been handled appropriately.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The distribution of key variables such as purchase amount, product categories, and customer demographics has been explored. Time-based patterns such as peak purchasing hours and days with high sales have been analyzed. The relationship between customer attributes and purchasing behavior has also been investigated.

Customer Segmentation: Clustering algorithms have been used to segment customers based on their buying behavior. The characteristics of different customer segments have been visualized.

Product Analysis: The top-selling products and product categories have been identified. The ratings and reviews of products have been analyzed to assess customer satisfaction.

Association Rules Mining: Frequent itemsets and association rules have been identified to understand product co-occurrences and cross-selling opportunities.

Churn Analysis (Optional): If the dataset included customer churn information, churn analysis would have been performed to identify factors contributing to customer attrition.

Data Visualization: Informative and visually appealing plots have been created to communicate the findings effectively.
Actionable Insights: Key findings have been summarized and actionable insights for the e-commerce business have been provided. Strategies have been suggested to increase customer retention, improve sales, or enhance customer experience.

Note: The dataset is in a zip file due to the size limitation in Git Hub.
